# Trailblazer
This is a simple program that visualizes four different searching algorithms. The graphical interface was already implemented and I made the searching algorithms.

Here are the algorithms
 - Depth-first search
 - Breadth-first search
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
 - A* search

All the algorithms can be found in src/trailblazer.cpp

This was a pretty simple project where I got to learn the most common searching algorithms. This was part of a datastructures course I took.

Have a good day :D
